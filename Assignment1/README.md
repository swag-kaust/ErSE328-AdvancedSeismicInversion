# Assignment 1 
In this assignment, we will run FWI on the Marmousi model given below: 
![Alt text](True_model.png) 

The marmousi model is provided in the file **Marm.bin**

Use the notebook to perform the following tasks 

Tasks:  
Running the notebook without any modification should yield the following inversion result
![Alt text](Inverted_model.png) 


1. Apply the inversion using different initial model (i.e. different smoothing) and observe the convergence.   
2. Apply a heavy smoothing to the initial model (maybe double the smoothing in the original notebook), then impliment FWI with and without filtering out frequencies below 7 Hz and observe the difference.

For each of the above tasks, explain your observation and the reason for the convergence behavior.  

You can submit your answers in a normal pdf report or using the jupyter notebook in a pdf format but you have to answer the question using Markdown mode.
