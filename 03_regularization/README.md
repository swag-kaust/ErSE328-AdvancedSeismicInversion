Built upon the knowledge we have from the previous assignment, the goal of this assignment is on improving the inversion results starting with a poor initial model.

# Objectives

The objective is making sure you can properly run an FWI cycle with Deepwave. Here are the list of items you should have in mind in submitting the assignment.

- [ ] Complete the missing codes
- [ ] Implement several regularization techniques and discuss the properties that they are aiming to impose on the model
- [ ] Analyze the effect regularization on the model and data

# Outcomes

Share the modified (hopefully well annotated) Jupyter notebook (or Python script with a separate PDF report file) to mohammad.taufik@kaust.edu.sa with `ErSE328-A34` as the subject.
