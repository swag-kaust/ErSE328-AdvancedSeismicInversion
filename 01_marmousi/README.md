In this assignment, we are trying to utilize the knowledge we have gained from the previous laboratory session into a different velocity model. You can refer to the previous notebook to fill in the missing codes and perform the inversion.

# Objectives

The objective is making sure you can properly run an FWI cycle with Deepwave. Here are the list of items you should have in mind in submitting the assignment.

- [ ] Complete the missing codes
- [ ] Analyze the effect of the initial model to the inverted velocity model
- [ ] Suggest (and perform) modifications to the acquisition setup, data frequency, objective function, etc to improve the result

# Outcomes

Share the modified (hopefully well annotated) Jupyter notebook (or Python script with a separate PDF report file) to mohammad.taufik@kaust.edu.sa with `ErSE328-A1` as the subject.
