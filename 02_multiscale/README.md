Built upon the knowledge we have from the previous assignment, the goal of this assignment is on improving the inversion results starting with a poor initial model.

# Objectives

The objective is making sure you can properly run an FWI cycle with Deepwave. Here are the list of items you should have in mind in submitting the assignment.

- [ ] Complete the missing codes
- [ ] Implement multiscale FWI and describe reasoning behind the chosen frequency windows
- [ ] Analyze the effect of different optimization algorithms, declare which algorithms performs best and explain why.

# Outcomes

Share the modified (hopefully well annotated) Jupyter notebook (or Python script with a separate PDF report file) to mohammad.taufik@kaust.edu.sa with `ErSE328-A2` as the subject.
