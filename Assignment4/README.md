# Assignment 4  

In this assignment we will impliment a regularized FWI. Specifically, we will test Tikhonov and total variation regularizations. We will also test aplpying FWI with different objective function that is immune to cycle skipping.   


### Tasks: 

     - Use the notebook to apply conventional FWI. Then apply the inversion with Tikhonov regulurization and total variation. Compare the results and comments on the differences between the two regulrizations.  
          
     - Look into letruture for some novel objective functions that are immune to cycle-skipping, impliment one of them in the second notebook and compare it with the conventional L2 objective.
