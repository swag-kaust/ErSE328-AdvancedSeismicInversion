# Assignment 2  

The goal for this notebook is to understand the important of low wavenumbers in the inversion. Thus, we will start with a linearly increasing model with depth (i.e., V(z)) model and apply a multiscaling apprach to converge. 

For the forward modelling, we will use the same Marmousi model used in the previous assignment. 


### Tasks: 

     - Aplpy FWI using the full data spectrum starting from 3 Hz, then apply a multi-scale approach to improve the inversion of v(z). Explain your steps and your observations. 
          
     - What is the minimum and maximum wavenumber expected for the first frequency range at depths 1,2,3 km?

Submit the code in a seprate file or at the end of your report.
