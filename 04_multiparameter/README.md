Built upon the knowledge we have from the previous assignment, the goal of this assignment is on improving the inversion results starting with a poor initial model.

# Objectives

The objective is making sure you can properly run an FWI cycle with Deepwave. Here are the list of items you should have in mind in submitting the assignment.

- [ ] Complete the missing codes
- [ ] Replace the previous acoustic solver with elastic solver
- [ ] Perform previously introduced techniques for multiparameter inversion (regularization, multiscale, etc)
- [ ] Analyze the major difference between acoustic and elastic inversion

# Outcomes

Share the modified (hopefully well annotated) Jupyter notebook (or Python script with a separate PDF report file) to mohammad.taufik@kaust.edu.sa with `ErSE328-A34` as the subject.
