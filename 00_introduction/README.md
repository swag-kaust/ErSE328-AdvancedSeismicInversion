In this very first assignment, we are trying to conduct our very first inversion. As you can see from this assignment, we will be relying on the Deepwave library as our wave propagation modules written in PyTorch. Thus, for those of who are familiar with PyTorch, implementing the inversion with Deepwave will be very straightforward.

# Objectives

In this assignment, the objective is making sure you can properly create the conda environment and the required packages to run the Jupyter notebook. After successfully running the notebook, you are encouraged to improve the current results with the knowledge you currently have from the course.

# Outcomes

Share the modified (hopefully well annotated) notebook (or Python script) to mohammad.taufik@kaust.edu.sa with `ErSE328-A0` as the subject.
